	<p> is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it the closest to Earth. It is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as Venus is almost as large and with a similar composition. Venus, like Mercury, appears in Earth's sky relatively close to the Sun either as morning star or evening star, resulting from them orbiting the Sun inside of Earth's orbit. Since Venus is orbiting relatively close to Earth it appears at times, during its synodic period of 1.6 years, with a maximal elongation of 47° to the Sun, allowing it to appear more than Mercury for up to a few hours after sunset and before sunrise in a completely dark sky. Venus furthermore appears more prominently than Mercury because it is after the Moon the brightest natural object in Earth's sky, capable of casting visible shadows on Earth at dark conditions and being visible to the naked eye in broad sunlight.[18][19]

Venus is the second largest terrestrial object of the Solar System, with a surface gravity minimally lower than on Earth, but having only an induced magnetosphere. Venus has a carbon dioxide atmosphere. The atmosphere of Venus is the densest of the four terrestrial planets. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from Earth in light. It may have had water oceans in the past,[20][21] but after these evaporated the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect.[22] The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of an internally induced magnetic field.[23] At roughly 50 km above the surface atmospheric conditions reach Earth-like temperatures and levels of pressure.

Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days,[24] but rotates around its axis in 243 Earth days. Consequently, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means that the Sun rises from its western horizon and sets in its east. This retrograde rotation creates a synodic day of only 117 Earth days.[25] Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.[26]

As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, gaining its mainly used name from the Roman goddess of love and beauty which it is associated with. Furthermore it has been a prime inspiration for writers, poets and scholars. Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BCE.[27]

Its proximity to Earth has made Venus a prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth spacecrafts were sent towards (Venera 1 in 1961) and the first to be reached, impacted and successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). The planet's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in the visible spectrum, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, such as crewed atmospheric missions at levels with allmost Earth-like conditions. The possibility of life on Venus has long been a topic of speculation; in recent years, the topic has received active research with possible signs of life having been found.</p>
